## About
This is a project that I developed in Week 4 of MIT xPro Bootcamp. MIT provided starter code for one eye.

>**Skills Highlighted**:
1. Bind DOM elements to mouse events.
2. Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to set web page styles.

>**Assignment Tasks**:
1. Add a second eye.
2. Make both eyes follow the mouse position on the screen.

## How to Run <img src='https://github.com/edwaggoner/responsive-eyes/blob/main/moving-eyes1.png' alt='Moving Eyes logo' width='30'> 
Move your mouse and see the eyes follow!

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Make pupils of the eyes go in circles when mouse position is between the eyes.
- [ ] Make pupil of an eye roll in a circle when mouse position is on that eye. 
- [ ] Add eyebrows that respond to mouse input.
- [ ] Add and style a nose.
